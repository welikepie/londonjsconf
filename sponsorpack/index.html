        Why hello there, LondonJS Conf future attendee (we hope). We're really looking forward to making LondonJS Conf as awesome as possible, and as you can understand, this site is a very basic holding page to let people know it's happening. If you've got any ideas on what you'd like to see to make the conference as awesome as possible, then let @arranrp, @lurkmoophy or @Charlotteis know on Twitter and we can hopefully meet your standards. Keep checking back to the site in coming months to see what we've got in store...

            <h2>Success of London JS</h2>

            <p>A lot of people have shouted about London JS over the past few years, which shows how much it’s loved. Here’s a few quotes pulled from Twitter:</p>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/jaffathecake" title="Jake on Twitter">@jaffathecake</a>: Very much enjoyed "pulling a Jake" at #ldnjs. Beer, pizza and geekery, in that order. Yeys!</blockquote>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/slightlylate" title="Alex on Twitter">@slightlylate</a>: #ldnjs had the most insightful questions of  anyplace I've given a talk this side of the planet.</blockquote>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/steakeye" title="Andrew on Twitter">@steakeye</a>: LondonJS is probably the most relevant, regular event for front-end devs in town with top-class speakers; I greatly appreciate it!</blockquote>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/teabass" title="Andrew on Twitter">@teabass</a>: #ldnjs If  you're in London and you like JS then it's a no brainer!</blockquote>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/mikemaccana" title="Mike on Twitter">@mikemaccana</a>: Awesome audience asking smart questions for my #ldnjs talk.</blockquote>

            <blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/francisrowland" title="Francis on Twitter">@francisrowland</a>: A roomful of people at #ldnjs learning about digital input/output for Arduino. Smiling, glowing faces - like Xmas morning. #electronics #js</blockquote>
